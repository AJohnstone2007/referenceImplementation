# referenceImplementation
This is a reference implementation of GLL and its variants written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott who are the authors of the GLL algorithm

Our goals are (a) to provide a 'programmar friendly' route into GLL and (b) to provide a baseline for principled performance testing of GLL implementations

The initial version of this project was presented at the Software Language Engineering 2023 conference near Lisbon. You can read the associated paper [here](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/publications/a-reference-gll-implementation)

We continue to extend the code and the associated test coprora. Please read the Technical Report 'GLL parsers' which you will find in GLLParsers.pdf
