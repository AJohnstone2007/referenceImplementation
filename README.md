# referenceImplementation
This is a reference implementation of GLL and its variants written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott; we are the authors of the GLL algorithm.

Our goals are (a) to provide a 'programmer friendly' route into GLL and (b) to provide a baseline for principled performance testing of GLL implementations

The initial version of this project was presented at the Software Language Engineering 2023 conference near Lisbon. You can read the associated paper [here](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/publications/a-reference-gll-implementation)

We continue to extend the code and the associated test corprora. Please read the Technical Report 'The GLL algorithm and its variants - 
a reference implementation' which you will find in ReferenceImplementationReport.pdf
