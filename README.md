# referenceImplementation
This is a reference implementation of GLL and its variants written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott; we are the authors of the GLL algorithm.

Our goals are (a) to provide a 'programmer friendly' route into GLL and (b) to provide a baseline for principled performance testing of GLL implementations

The initial version of this work was presented at the Software Language Engineering 2023 conference near Lisbon. You can read the associated paper [here](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/publications/a-reference-gll-implementation). The slides from that presentation are in __referenceImplementationSlides.pdf__

We continue to extend the code and the associated grammars and test corprora. For a current account of this work, please read the Technical Report _The GLL algorithm and its variants - 
a reference implementation_ which you will find in __referenceImplementationReport.pdf__
