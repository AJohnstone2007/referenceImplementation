For the main V5 specification grammar, we keep the most recent and the current term 

1. The reference script grammar is in the file 

src\uk\ac\rhul\cs\csle\art\ARTScriptSpecification.art

2. The derivation term is held in the first variable declared in ARTScriptInterpreter.java

private final String scriptParserTermString = ...

3. Edit ARTSPecification.art to suit new ideas

4. Parse ARTSpecification.art against itself and output the derivation with directive !print derivation

5. Replace scriptParserTermString with the new term, remembering the old one in case we break things

6. Repeat 3-5 until the 'Bootstrap achieved' message appears
